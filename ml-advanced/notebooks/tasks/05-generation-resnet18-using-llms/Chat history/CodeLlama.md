### USER
Write a custom implementation of ResNet-18 and its training code using PyTorch.

### ASSISTANT

Here is an example of how you could implement a custom ResNet-18 architecture in PyTorch:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class ResNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=10):
        super(ResNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.residual1 = ResidualBlock(64)
        self.residual2 = ResidualBlock(64)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(64, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = self.maxpool(x)
        x = self.residual1(x)
        x = self.residual2(x)
        x = x.view(-1, 64)
        x = self.linear(x)
        return x

class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels=None):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        if out_channels is None:
            out_channels = in_channels
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.batchnorm = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)

    def forward(self, x):
        residual = x
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = self.batchnorm(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x += residual
        return x

# Training code
num_epochs = 50
learning_rate = 0.001

model = ResNet()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for x, y in train_loader:
        # Forward pass
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = criterion(y_pred, y)

        # Backward and optimize
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
This code defines a custom ResNet-18 architecture using PyTorch, which consists of two residual blocks with 64 filters each, followed by a linear layer with 10 outputs (for the number of classes in your dataset). The `forward` method defines how input data flows through the network, and the `residual1` and `residual2` methods define the residual blocks.

The training code uses the `train_loader` to iterate over the training data, computes the loss for each batch using the `CrossEntropyLoss` criterion, and optimizes the model parameters using the `SGD` optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The `num_epochs` variable specifies the number of training epochs, and the `learning_rate` variable sets the initial learning rate for the optimizer.

Note that this is just one example of how you could implement a custom ResNet-18 architecture in PyTorch. There are many other ways to do it, and you may need to modify this code to fit your specific use case.
